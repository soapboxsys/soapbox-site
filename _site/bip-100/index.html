            <p>In spite of commenting on the block size debate, here is a widget that 
            simulates behavoirs of miners voting for their preferences. There are
            three AI's encoded within each of whom has different goals. 
            The simulation produces some interesting results, but you should draw your 
            own conclusions.

            <h4>12,000 blocks are not generated at regular intervals.</h4>
            <p>
            This simulator picks a point in time in the future when voting ends. 
            The actual algorithm just counts the last 12,000 blocks from the last block size adjustment.
            </p>
            <h4>Generation of blocks is a random process.</h4>
            <p>That is to say that every miner has their hashpower percentage chance of generating 
            any given block. This is not really true in the wild thanks to things like <a href="">block withholding</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Miners use a single strategy.</h4>
            <p>This is a nessecary evil if we are going to try and simulate behavoir.</p>
            <h4>The simulation approximates those strategies.</h4>
            <p>This is a big assumption and is probably not true.</p>
