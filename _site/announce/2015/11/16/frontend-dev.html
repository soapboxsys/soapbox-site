    <p class="post-meta">Nov 16, 2015 • Nick</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We put out a call for a developer that reads something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Soapbox Systems is a software development group started by two UVA and HC alums based in Washington DC. We are looking for a front-end developer with design skills or a designer with strong web development skills to build and design a front-end for Ombuds. 
 
If you or somebody you know is interested in working with a rag-tag group of miscreants producing copy-left technology literally intended to resist oppression and protect human rights email me at: nick@soapbox.systems

And yes, you can even get paid – some money – to do this! And no, we don’t mind if you are a full-time student.
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of this page is to describe in detail the work we need done. </p>

<p>There are two main tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Redesign getombuds.org</li>
  <li>Construct a web front-end for the Ombuds REST API.</li>
</ol>

<p>We view both of equal importance, but #2 is the harder more integrated problem. 
So what we are doing is using #1 to see if someone can join our team to solve #2.
If you would like to get paid to work on #1 with the potential for further work on #2 email us.
After an initial conversation and back and forth on ideas+designs for #1, we will start paying you to build it.</p>

<h1 id="redesigning-getombudsorg">Redesigning getombuds.org</h1>

<p>This site should be the public face of a technologically sophisticated open-source project.
<a href="https://getombuds.org">The current site</a> does reflect that. 
Last spring, we worked with a design company to radically improve our marketing appeal. 
This did not work because the resulting site was low content, slow to load, and a marketing pitch. 
It was mainly our fault and we do not have any screen shots of the site either… </p>

<p>So, what we are looking for now is a suitable home for the Ombuds project. 
This includes a friendly front-page that acts as a sign post that directs the viewer: to download the software, read the documentation (and paper), learn about the people who made it and so on. </p>

<p>While the look and feel should be different, the Tor project’s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">site</a> provides an excellent reference.
Be aware though, this is 2015 websites can look better than that – not that we know how to make it look better…</p>

<p>The content of the site should at the minimum contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A high level description of the project</li>
  <li>A place to post announcements, blog posts, and victories.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/soapboxsys/ombuds-spec/blob/master/doc/index.md">spec</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/soapboxsys/ombuds-site/blob/master/res/ombuds-public-space.pdf">paper</a>, and links to other technical documentation.</li>
  <li>A set of pages devoted to downloading the software and warning users about its use.</li>
  <li>Information about the team, sponsors, partners, and funders.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current site uses Jekyll. 
Jekyll supports markdown, blogging, and fast static sites. 
So it has everything you should need. </p>

<p>We plan to use the <a href="https://github.com/soapboxsys/ombuds-site">same repository</a> and simply face lift the site for the redesign.
Additionally, the domain name getombuds.org will change – we are not sure to what, but we are open to suggestions.</p>

<p>For your reference here are great home pages for other top-notch open source projects.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://coreos.com/">Core OS</a> – very swanky…</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> – The right info in an old form.</li>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go language</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://jasperproject.github.io">Jasper Project</a> – don’t nessecarily like the home-page</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">Cyanogenmod</a> – The best in the list.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="constructing-a-web-front-end-for-ombuds">Constructing a Web Front-end for Ombuds</h1>

<p>The Ombuds <a href="https://github.com/soapboxsys/ombuds-spec/blob/master/doc/index.md">specification</a> defines an <a href="https://github.com/soapboxsys/ombuds-spec/blob/master/doc/web-relay-api.md">HTTP API</a> for records that are stored in the public record.</p>

<p>These records can be displayed in several different ways to a viewer. 
The mobile app that Alex is building will consume this API.
We would like a web-browser to also be able to consume the API.</p>

<p>Websites that display this content on the web has been done before by Nick.
Those sites (<a href="https://github.com/NSkelsey/ahimsa-web">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NSkelsey/OmbudsRetweeter">2</a>) were either single use or now obsolete (the API has changed).</p>

<p>A fresh set of eyes and ideas will be crucial in deciding how to relay and show relevant information to users.
We have documented exactly how the API functions <a href="https://github.com/soapboxsys/ombuds-spec/blob/master/doc/web-relay-api.md#5-api-routes-and-responses">here</a>.</p>
