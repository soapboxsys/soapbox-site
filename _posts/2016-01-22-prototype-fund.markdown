On Jan 20, Alex and I dodged a snowstorm and traveled to Pittsburgh to attend an ideation workshop hosted by the good people at [LUMA](https://www.luma-institute.com/) and demo Ombuds.

We put an app in the [Android app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=systems.soapbox.ombuds.client) for the event and we stood up a [Testnet Retweeter](https://twitter.com/boxsoapbot) which broke horribly  â€“ you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/NSkelsey/OmbudsRetweeter#ombudsretweeter).

All in all it was a great time with some great people.
