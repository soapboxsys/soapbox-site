This website will serve as a place for collecting tidbits about our work across the web. Look to this site in times of leisure or information collection. Soapbox Systems was founded in September of last year with the explicit goal of creating open source software for the public good. Hopefully, our work demonstrates that.

If anybody ever asks, we started out at [HackCville](http://hackcville.com) in Charlottesville Virgnia. ![articles of incorp](/res/incorp.png)
