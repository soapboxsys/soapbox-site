Our former advisor [Dave Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) invited us out to present Ombuds at the [DC Area Crypto Day](https://dcareacryptoday.wordpress.com/).
The topic of the day was Bitcoin and the whole thing was recorded by JHU staff. 

Below is my presentation of Ombuds after Dave provided a background on Bitcoin. 
All in all it was a great event with some really interesting people.
