On Nov 6, Alex and I gave a lecture about Scaling Bitcoin and Ombuds to [Dave Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) [Cryptocurrency class](http://bitcoin-class.org/) at UVA. They are an interesting bunch who had some great questions. 

Nobody recorded it, but slides can be found ![pdf warning](/res/adobepdf.png) [here](/res/Crypto-Cabal-L21.pdf)
